# Take-Home Challenge: URL Stats Aggregation & Reporting API

## Overview

You must build a **FastAPI**-based microservice that handles two primary functions:

1. **Shorten URLs** – The service stores long URLs, returns a short slug, and tracks usage statistics (visits).  
2. **Aggregate/Report** – The service provides an endpoint to query aggregated stats (e.g., total visits per link, top N visited links, etc.).  

Your goal is to design, implement, and deploy this service so we can test it live and evaluate its code and performance characteristics.

**Important**: This brief describes a lot of functionality. If you don't have the time to fully design and implement the features described in this brief that is fine!
Try to implement a solution:
1. written using fastapi
2. has a database layer
3. can easily be run locally for testing
4. it's ok to use AI but make sure you still show off your capabilities as an engineer (no slop, make sure that any generated code is thoroughly reviewed)

## Requirements

### 1. Short Link Creation

- **Endpoint**: `POST /shorten`
- **Request Body** (example):
  ```json
  {
    "long_url": "https://www.example.com/very/long/url"
  }
  ```
- **Response** (example):
  ```json
  {
    "slug": "abcd123",
    "short_url": "http://your-service.com/abcd123"
  }
  ```
- Behavior:
  - Store the mapping of slug → original URL in your database.
  - Return a generated slug and the corresponding short URL.
  - Decide whether to reuse an existing slug if the same long_url is posted again or always generate a new slug. Document your choice.
 
### 2. Redirection

- **Endpoint**: GET /{slug}
- **Behavior**:
  - Look up slug in the database.
  - If found, redirect (HTTP 307) to the original long_url.
  - If not found, return 404.
  - Track usage: each time the short URL is accessed, increment a visit counter or store a timestamp record (so we can produce stats).

### 3. Reporting / Analytics
- Provide one or more endpoints to retrieve usage stats:
  - GET /stats – Return the top N links by total visits, or another useful summary.
  - GET /stats/{slug} – Return data about how many times that link was visited, timestamps of visits, etc.
- The exact shape of the data is up to you. An example response might be:
```json
[
  {
    "slug": "abcd123",
    "long_url": "https://www.example.com/...",
    "visits": 42,
    "last_visit": "2025-12-01T13:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Additional Consideration
Think about these things as you are designing your implementation

### Database
- You must use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- Show how you manage schema or migrations.
- Consider indexing. This service could potentially handle a high volume of requests.

### Scalability
- The service may receive bursts of traffic or a large backlog of links.
- Show a concurrency strategy (e.g., how FastAPI handles multiple requests).
- No need for a fully distributed system, but demonstrate an approach that wouldn’t deadlock or degrade severely under moderate scale.

### Deployment
- Provide a Dockerfile and instructions (or a docker-compose.yml) to run the service.
- If possible, host it somewhere we can test (like a small VM or container).

### Testing
- Include a basic test suite (e.g., pytest) verifying endpoints.
- Unit tests for core logic + an integration test or two for the overall API are ideal.

### Code Quality & Documentation
- Clean, logical Python code with appropriate docstrings and function naming.
- A short README.md explaining how to install, run, and test your project.
- Good structure: for instance, separate modules for models, routes, and “business logic” or “services.”


## Evaluation Criteria

### We’ll be reviewing:
- API correctness: Does the service meet the requirements?
- Database design: Are schemas, indices, and queries well thought-out?
- Performance: Any obviously inefficient design choices (e.g., storing massive data in memory, no indexing)?
- Code clarity: Is the Python code idiomatic, maintainable, and logically separated?
- Deployment: Can we hit the API?

### Deliverables
Please fork the provided Git repository and submit a link to your repository:

- Source code in Python + FastAPI.
- App setup (Dockerfile / docker-compose / sh script).
- README.md with:
  - Setup instructions
  - How to run tests
  - Any design notes or trade-offs you made

Feel free to reach out to discuss any features or to get a review on a pr pre-submission.
In the following interview we will be spinning up your service and running some locust tests on it.

Good luck and have fun.
